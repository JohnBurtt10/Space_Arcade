# SPACE ARCADE
## What this Project does
- This project was made as a fun side project originally based off of the classic Atari game Space Race, and changed into something of an arcade game with multiple modes. The main function of this project is to provide entertainment to the players.

## Why is This Project Useful
- The main use of this project is to be able to play and compete with friends for the best highscore.
- The project could also be used as a learning opportunity for anyone trying to get into simple game development using HTML 5 and Javascript, or anyone looking to learn about any of the functions that we used. Such as locally stored databases. 

## How we Built This Game 
- We wrote this game using classic Atari as our fundamental template, for which we coded our base game "Space Race" from the ground up, using HTML 5, CSS, and Javascript. From that point using the same languages we added two additional game modes "Hot!" and "Zapped!", as well as many different attributes such as an account system, a shop, leaderboards, better formatting and organization, as well as many other HTML files such as instructions, and better menu control.

## Accomplishments that we are proud of
- Throughout this project we have run into many roadblocks and problems and we are proud that we never quit and have always found a solution to the problem.
- Another accomplishment that we are proud of is learning and incorporating so many new layers to our project that it could almost pass as a game that could be found and played online.
