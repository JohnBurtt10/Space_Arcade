			<backstory>That was amazing what you did back there, what with dodging those asteroids that were coming from every which direction. You've really got to teach me to fly like that once you get back to Earth. Anyways, I didn't want to bring this up because I felt like we were starting to become friends but, we may have miscalculated how much water you would need to make it back to Earth, by a large margin. This wouldn't be such a big deal but the atmosphere of the planet you're at is extremly HOT! Hope is not lost however, because Pluto's atmosphere contains randomly generating blobs of water. All you need to do now is go collect enough water to not overheat, and maybe even a little bit extra for the ride home.

			<blog>OBJECTIVE: Fly around collecting the 'blobs of water' which decrease your 'hot' temperature by 1. Be careful though, because your 'hot' temperature naturally increases over time and if it reaches 10, you lose. </blog>
