		<blog> Hey astronauts! I'm making this blog post today to announce the end of the main development period of Space Arcade. Our team has been working hard for the past 6 months and we're now happy with where the games are. We'd like to thank everyone who voted for Space Arcade at the Qoom showcase, winning that felt like all of our hard work was recognized. The end of the development period does not mean we are abandonding the game by any means, as we will still be monitoring our emails for any feedback, however our attention will be focused in other places and the implementation of any new features will be put on hold at the very least for the forseeable future. The Space Arcade team thanks you for you understanding and as always for your continuous support!

		<blog> Hey astronauts! Oh boy have we ever been busy. In the past week we've added our very own currency into the game called 'Space Dollars' which you can now earn in any of our three current games and spend in the shop on ship skins. We've completely revamped our 'Game Over' screen and made it so that you can see the score you just achieved, your personal best score for whichever game you're playing and your total 'Space Dollars'. You can look forward to many more items coming to the shop in the near future as well as a 'Profile' page with your game stats.

		<blog> Hey astronauts! There isn't much to report since our last post, however we are happy to announce the beta release of skins! In our 'Space Race' and 'Zapped' gamemodes you can now cosmetically customize your playing experience by choosing the color of your ship and some other aspects of the games. We're working to add a lot more options for colors so look out for that!

		<blog_title> VERTICALLY MOVING WATER? </blog_title>
		<!-- Date -->
		<blog_date> August 10th, 2021 </blog_date>
		<!-- Blog entry -->
		<blog> Hey astronauts! I'm going to try to keep this update short. Over the past few days we got to a version of 'HOT!' that we were happy with in terms of gameplay, which pretty much means we got the water to move both horizontally and vertically. I don't mean to sound bias or anything but I personally think this makes the game a lot more fun. In terms of features other than gameplay, we hope to continue to improve the game visually and finish development on the leaderboards in the next few days, so keep an eye out for that!

		<blog_title> THIRD GAME </blog_title>
		<!-- Date -->

		<!-- Blog entry -->
		<blog> Hey astronauts! This message was already posted on the 'News' page so if you've already read it there, there won't be anything new to you here. I'd like to start off by thanking you on the behalf of all of the developers on the team for your continuous support from the original release of 'Space Race' to the release of the beta version of HOT!. I can't begin to thank you guys for this and we hope that the news that we are beginning development on our new game, which will be the third installment of our game arcade is exciting to many of you. I can't say much about the new game yet, but I can say if you are a fan of dodgeball I think you will be in a treat on August 18th, 2021, when the game is set to release. Continue to check back here for news of the new game and anything else to do with 'Space Race' games. </blog>

		<blog_title> THE FINAL RELEASE OF HOT! </blog_title>
		<!-- Date -->
		<blog_date> July 25th, 2021 </blog_date>
		<!-- Blog entry -->
		<blog> Hey astronauts! We have been receiving for the most part, very positive feedback on the beta release of 'HOT!'. There is still however, very much work to be done before the final release of the game, which we are hoping will be sometime before September. The firs step we are taking to get 'HOT!' ready for its final release is developing its leaderboard. The leaderboard standings will be based on how long each player lasts before overheating. Additionally, we are planning to take an in-depth look at the behavior and appearance of the water which is what you are flying around the screen trying to collect. As of right now, they look and act pretty much identically to the asteroids from 'Space Race' which has worked for the meantime, however we are not content releasing the final version of the game with the water in its current state. If you have any more feedback or bugs to report for 'HOT!' or any of our other releases, please see the new 'Feedback' page on the start screen. </blog>
