			<backstory>Phew! I thought you were a gonner there for a minute- I mean the other guys here at NASA thought you were done for for sure. I always knew you had it in you and would you look at that, you did! The only problem is that this next challenge is going to make collecting that water back there on Pluto seem like a piece of cake. Our radars detect a storm approaching your position, and not just any regular storm, the unique atmospheric conditions of your location create storms made up completely of electricity. It goes without saying that you don't want to come into contact with any of this electricty. In order to surive, you're going to have to evade the electric currents flying around until the storm subsides. If you've proven anything, it's that if anyone can do this, it's you astronaut.

			<blog>OBJECTIVE: Don't come into contact with any of the 'electric currents' as every time you do, you will lose one of your three lives. The electric currents increase in size every 15 seconds and spawn in a new random location, your best chance is to use the areas on the top and the bottom of the screen where the electric currents cannot spawn. So make sure to head there every 15 seconds to avoid being hit as soon as they spawn.</blog>
