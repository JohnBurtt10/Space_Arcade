				<backstory>The Earth is in a crucial state! Pollution has now almost completly filled our atmosphere. You have been chosen to take part in the mission to explore the galaxy in attempt to find another habitable planet. However, be carful as it will not be easy. You will constantly have to be dodging space debris coming at you from all directions.
					Good luck astronaut! 
					<br><br>You may be Earth's last hope...

				<blog>OBJECTIVE: Make it to the top of the screen without coming into contact with any space debris. If you collide with any space debris your ship will be destroyed and you lose. Each time you reach the top of the screen your score is increased by one, be careful though because the higher your score, the more space debris will spawn and the faster the space debris will be moving. </blog>
